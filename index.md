## Project Background

According to a new article in 2024, Baltimore has been ranked as the “deadliest large city in the nation.” [1] Especially in terms of large cities (with more than 500,000 population), Baltimore has exceeded the danger of Memphis and Detroit, which used to be the worst in the past. [1]

The crime problem is a significant issue in Baltimore city, which threatens the surrounding industries and institutions. [2] According to the report, there have been exceptionally high amount of robbery, especially in terms of violence crime within the city. [1] Therefore, the variety of crime is something that worth getting into within the project.

From our data set, we noted that the crime count had been high up in the past years (∼50,000 cases each year). [3] Hence, we want to analyze about the efficiency of the police departments and look for a more optimal set up. We aim to use Machine Learning to explore approaches that can potentially address the issues with crime in the city.
